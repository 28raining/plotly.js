## Directory of draft logs to help prepare the upcoming [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

It is required that the PR contributors start the filename with a number.
This number should preferably be the PR number.
The number of issue they are trying to close could also be used.
The markdown file should end with one of the followings:
1. `_fix.md` to propose a bug fix
2. `_add.md` to propose new features
3. `_remove.md` to propose a feature removal
4. `_change.md` to propose a minor/major change
5. `_deprecate.md` to propose a feature deprecate

### Example filename and content for PR numbered 5546 for adding a new feature
- filename: `5546_add.md`
- content:
```
 - Add `icicle` trace type [[#5546](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/5546)]
```
which would render
 - Add `icicle` trace type [[#5546](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/5546)]

> Please start your single-line or multiple lined message with a verb. You could basically use the PR description while providing a link to the PR similar to the above example is appreciated too.
