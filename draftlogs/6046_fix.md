- Fix interaction between `uirevision` and `autorange`. Because we push `autorange` and `range` back into `layout`, there can be times it looks like we're applying GUI-driven changes on top of explicit autorange and other times it's an implicit autorange, even though the user's intent was always implicit. This fix treats them as equivalent. [[#6046](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/6046)]
